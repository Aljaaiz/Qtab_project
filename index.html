                morning & evenings Uthman (R.A.) reported that Prophet Mohammad
                (S.A.W.) has said that (nothing will harm) the servant who
                recites these words three times every morning and evening.

              بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَا يَضُرُّ مَعَ اسْمِهِ شَيْءٌ فِي

              have made (started) the morning (and night) in whose Name
              nothing in the skies and the earth can harm and He is the
              All-hearing, the All-knowing. (Tirmidhi) It is narrated by Abu
              Dawood that if one recites this dua in the morning, no
              unforeseen calamity will come to him. (Miskhat) Prophet Mohammad
              (S.A.W.) said that if a person recites three ayats of Surah Rum
              (Para 21) and if he misses his normal recitation of the day, he
              will still be rewarded for it. This applies to the night as
              well. فَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ حِينَ تُمْسُونَ وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُونَ *
              وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَعَشِيًّا

              وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَيُحْيِي الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ
              مَوْتِهَا وَكَذَلِكَ تُخْرَجُونَ "So remember Allah in the
              evening and the morning. To him is the praise in the Heavens and
              the Earth and in the last hours and when it is noon. He brings
              forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living and
              He revives the earth after it is dead. And even so you shall be
              brought forth". Abu Huraira (R.A) narrated that Prophet Mohammad
              (S.A.W.) said that whosoever reads the beginning of Surah Mo'min
              (para 24) and Ayatul-Qursi in the morning, then he will be
              protected from calamaties and ploys till the evening and
              whosoever recites these in the evenings, will be protected from
              calamities and ploys till the morning. حم * تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَابِ
              مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ * غَافِرِ الذَّنبِ وَقَابِلِ

              هُوَ إِلَيْهِ الْمَصِيرُ "Ha. Meem, The sending down of this
              book is from Allah who is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing, The
              Forgiver of sins and the Acceptor of repentance, Severe in
              retribution, Bountiful there is no ilah but He, Unto Him is our
              return". اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ
              لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلاَ نَوْمٌ لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ
              وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ
              بِإِذْنِهِ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ
              وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَاءَ
              وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَلاَ يَئُودُهُ
              حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ Allah! There is no ilah
              (deity worthy of worship) but He The Living, The Eternal One.
              Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belonges
              whatever is in the Heavens and on the earth. Who is he that can
              intercede with Him but by His permission? He knows what is
              before and what is behind them. They encompass nothing of His
              knowledge which He will. His Throne extends over the Heavens and
              the Earth, and the preservation of both does not weary Him. He
              is the Exalted The Immense One. (Qur'an 2:255) Prophet Mohammad
              (S.A.W.) stated that a person who has recited (the underlying)
              in the morning, he has pleased (praised, glorified) Allah for
              His favours of the morning, and if he has done so in the night,
              he has thanked Allah for His favours of the night. (Abu Dawood,
              Nisai) اللَّهُمَّ مَا أَصْبَحَ بِي مِنْ نِعْمَةٍ أَوْ بِأَحَدٍ
              مِنْ خَلْقِكَ فَمِنْكَ وَحْدَكَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَكَ فَلَكَ
              الْحَمْدُ وَلَكَ الشُّكْرُ Translation: "O Allah, whatever
              favours You have bestowed upon me and all other creations is
              only from you. You are One, You have no partners. Praise and
              Shukr (thanks) be to You". If recited in the night, then recite
              مَا أمَْسيَ in place of مَا أَصْبَحَ بِي Thuban (R.A.) narrated
              that Prophet Mohammad (SAW) stated that if a Muslim servant
              recites (the underlying) three times every morning, then it
              becomes the responsibility of Allah to satisfy him on the Day of
              Qiyamah. رَضِيتُ بِاللَّهِ رَبَّاً وَبِالْإِسْلَامِ دِينَاً
              وَبِمُحَمَّدٍ نَبِيَّاً Translation: I am pleased with Allah as
              my Lord, Islam as my Deen and Muhammad (SAW) as my Nabi.
              (Tirmidhi) Muagal bin Yasaar (R.A.) narrates that Prophet
              Mohammad (S.A.W.) has stated that a person who recites three
              times أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ السَّمِيعِ الْعَلِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ
              الرَّجِيمِ in the morning the last three ayats of Suratul Hashr
              then Allah delegates 70,000 angles to send mercy onto him till
              the evening and if he dies that day, he will die as a martyr and
              if he recites these in the evening then Allah delegates 70,000
              angels to send mercy onto him till the morning and if he dies
              that night, he dies as martyr. (Tirmidhi) هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي
              لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ عَالِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَادَةِ هُوَ
              الرَّحْمَنُ الرَّحِيمُ * هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ
              هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ السَّلامُ الْمُؤْمِنُ الْمُهَيْمِنُ
              الْعَزِيزُ الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ عَمَّا
              يُشْرِكُونَ * هُوَ اللَّهُ الْخَالِقُ الْبَارِئُ الْمُصَوِّرُ
              لَهُ الْأَسْمَاءُ الْحُسْنَى يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَا فِي
              السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ * "He is
              Allah, there is no ilah but He, He is the knower of the unseen
              and the witness He is the All-Merciful, the All compassionate.
              He is Allah, there is no ilah but He. He is the king, the Holy,
              the Giver of Safety. The Taker-in shelter the All-Mighty, the
              omnipotent, the All-Sublime. Allah is Pure and Pure of what they
              associate (with Him). He is Allah, the Creator, the One who is
              Perfect. To Him belong names Most Excellent. All that is in the
              heavens and the earth, glorify Him and He is the All-Mighty, the
              All-Wise". Ataa bin Abi Rahaa (R.A.) narrates that Prophet
              Mohammad (S.A.W.) has stated that if a person recites Surah
              Yaseen early in the morning then his need for the day will be
              fullfilled. (Mishkat) Benefit: The recitation of Surah Ikhlaas,
              Surah Falaq and Surah Naas three times each in the mornings and
              evenings, has been encouraged in the Ahadith. (Hisn-ulHasin)
              Supplications to be recited at night Abdullah bin Masood (R.A.)
              states that Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) has said that the person
              who recites Suratul Waqia (para 27) every night, will never be
              poverty stricken (hungry) (Baihagi in Shabatul Iman) Uthman
              (R.A.) states that a person who recites from إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ
              السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ in Surah Al-Imran till the end of the
              Surah on any night or part of the night, will receive the reward
              of performing his Salaat for the whole night. (Mishkat) Jabir
              (R.A.) states that Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) never slept before
              reciting Surah Alif Laam Meem Sajda (21 para) and Surah
              Tabarakal Lazi. (Mishkat) Abdullah bin Masood (R.A.) narrates
              that Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) has stated that the person who
              recites the last two ayats of Suratul Baqarah till the end, then
              these two ayats will be sufficient for him, i.e. Allah will
              protect him from all evil and ploys. (Bukhari, Muslim) When
              retiring to sleep, make wudhu, dust off the bed three times, lie
              on the right side, place the right hand under the head or cheeks
              and recite the following dua three times. (Mishkat and Hsinul
              Hasin, Bukhari Muslim) اللَّهُمَّ قِنِي عَذَابَكَ يَوْمَ
              تَجْمَعُ عِبَادَكَ "O Allah, save me from the punishment on the
              Day when You will gather Your servants". Alternatively recite
              this dua بِاسْمِكَ رَبِّي وَضَعْتُ جَنْبِي وَبِكَ أَرْفَعُهُ
              إِنْ أَمْسَكْتَ نَفْسِي فَارْحَمْهَا وَإِنْ أَرْسَلْتَهَا
              فَاحْفَظْهَا بِمَا تَحْفَظُ بِهِ عِبَادَكَ الصَّالِحِينَ "Oh my
              Lord, I have taken Your name and placed myself on my side and by
              Your power will rise up again. If you take my soul whilst I am
              sleeping (grant me death) then have mercy on my soul and if you
              leave me (let me live) by your power protect me by that with
              which you have protected your righteous servants". (Bukhari,
              Muslim) Or recite this dua اللَّهُمَّ بِاسْمِكَ أَمُوتُ
              وَأَحْيَا "O Allah, by Your name I live and die". (Bukhari,
              Muslim) Or recite this dua اللَّهُمَّ أَسْلَمْتُ نَفْسِي
              إِلَيْكَ وَوَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِي إِلَيْكَ وَفَوَّضْتُ أَمْرِي
              إِلَيْكَ وَأَلْجَأْتُ ظَهْرِي إِلَيْكَ رَغْبَةً وَرَهْبَةً
              إِلَيْكَ لَا مَلْجَأَ وَلَا مَنْجَا مِنْكَ إِلَّا إِلَيْكَ
              آمَنْتُ بِكِتَابِكَ الَّذِي أَنْزَلْتَ وَنَبِيِّكَ الَّذِي
              أَرْسَلْتَ "I submit my life to you, I turn towards You and
              leave my work unto you, I lean on you, desire your boons and
              fear you as there is no other salvation besides you. I believe
              in the kitab (Book) you have revealed and in the Rasul(Prophet)
              you have sent. Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) showed (taught a
              Sahabi) this dua and said: "If after reading it you die in the
              night, then it is as if you have died on 'Natural Deen' and if
              you awake in the morning alive then you will have good fortune".
              (Mishkat) Anas (R.A.) narrates that Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.)
              said that if a person retires to bed on the side and recites
              Surah Fathiha and Surah Ikhlaas (Qul huwa- Allaho Ahad) he is
              immune from everything besides death. (Hisnul Hasan from Albazr)
              Sahabi (R.A.) requested Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) that Prophet
              Mohammad (S.A.W.) teach him something to recite at the time of
              retiring to bed. Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) said: "Recite Qul Ya
              Ayuhal Kafiroon, for in it (there is an announcement) to refrain
              from shirk. (Mishkat from Tirmidhi) In some ahadith it is stated
              that one should sleep after reciting (i.e. not to talk after
              reciting it). (Hisnul Hasin from Albazr) Ayesha (R.A.) narrates
              that when Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) used to go to the room for
              sleep, he used to recite Suras Ikhlaas, Falaq, Nass and blow
              onto his hand (palms) in such a manner that the saliva would
              drop on them and then he would rub them over his body three
              times starting from the front of the face. (Bukhari, Muslim)
              Beside this he would recite 33 times سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ 33 times
              الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ 34 times اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ (Mishkat) He also
              used to recite Ayatul Qursi as Allah has stipulated that the
              reciter will be protected throughout the night by the angels and
              the Satan will not come near. (Bukhari) Also recite this dua
              three times أَسْتَغْفِرُ اللَّهَ الَّذِي لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا هُوَ
              الْحَيَّ الْقَيُّومَ وَأَتُوبِ إِلَيْهِ Its virtues are that all
              the reciter's sins will be forgiven even if it be equal to the
              extent of the foam in the ocean. (Tirmidhi) Recite Bismillah
              while closing doors, covering utensils, and putting off the
              light (candles etc.) (Mishkat) Prophet Mohammad (S.A.W.) said
              that when a person enters his bed (to sleep), an angel and a
              Shaitaan surround him. The Shaitaan whispers 'your awakening
              will end in evil' and the angel says' end in good". One sleeps
              after engaging in dhikr, the angels will protect him throughout
              the night. In order to gain the protection of the angels, it is
              wise to engage in Dhikr and then sleep. (Hisnul Hasin)

              Step by Step Guide to Performing an Umrah


              Umrah is an Islamic pilgrimage and is, in short, an act of worship of Allah (SWT). It is based on the
              teachings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and his Sunnah. The pilgrimage is a visit to the House of Allah (SWT)
              and can be carried out any time of the year. It is known as a ‘minor pilgrimage’ in comparison to the
              ‘greater pilgrimage’ of Hajj. However, it holds great value and virtue in the eyes of Allah (SWT).

              The Umrah comprises of four basic pillars:

              1) Ihram
              Ihram is essentially making the formal ‘intention’ of performing the Umrah. In order to enter the fold of
              Ihram, the individual must change clothes and take a proper bath (ghusl) which showcases an act of washing
              away all impurities. Men change into the two fabrics, Ridaa and Izaar, whereas women can wear any form of
              clothing which covers the body and head. Women who are menstruating or experiencing postnatal bleeding are
              also advised to perform ghusl.

              Upon the cleansing, the individual should perform the obligatory prayers or offer two rakaat of Sunnah
              prayer. Once that is done, the individual should face the direction of the Qibla and officially enter
              Ihram – the individual must enter Ihram before he/she leaves for the Meeqat in Makkah. Perfume or perfumed
              products are strictly prohibited while a person is in his/her Ihram.

              At the Meeqat, the pilgrim must make the intention and recite the words:

              “Labbayk Allaahumma bi ‘Umrah”
              (Here I am, O Allah, for ‘Umrah)

              After this, he/she should recite the Talbiyah, in line with the Sunnah:

              “Labbayka Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk. Inna al-hamd wa’l-ni’mata laka
              wa’l-mulk, laa shareeka lak”

              (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings
              are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).”

              It is advised that the individual keep reciting the Talbiyah from the moment he/she enters Ihram until
              he/she gets to the performance of the Tawaaf.

              2) Tawaaf (around the House of Allah (SWT))
              The pilgrim must then enter Masjid al-Haram, and that too with his/her right foot and recite:

              “Bismillaah wa’l-salaatu wa’l-salaam ‘ala Rasool-Allaah. Allaahumma ighfir li dhunoobi waftah li abwaab
              rahmatika. A’oodhu Billaah il-‘Azeem wa bi wajhih il-kareem wa bi sultaanih il-‘qadeem min al-Shaytaan
              il-rajeem”

              (In the name of Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah. O Allah, forgive me my sins
              and open to me the gates of Your mercy. I seek refuge with Allah the Almighty and in His noble Countenance
              and His eternal power from the accursed Satan).”

              The pilgrim can then touch the Black Stone (Hajr e Aswad) and start the Tawaaf. Ideally, the pilgrim
              should touch it with his right hand and then kiss it. If, however, he/she is unable to kiss it directly,
              he/she can touch it with his/her hand then kiss his/her hand. There is great virtue in touching the Black
              Stone. If he/she cannot even touch the stone with his/her hand, the pilgrim should face his/her hand in
              the direction of the stone and say “Allahu Akbar”. Then the pilgrim starts the Tawaaf – taking rounds
              around the Ka’bah, with the Ka’bah being on their left. One must be careful not to touch the cloth of the
              Ka’bah during Tawaaf as it is perfumed and touching it might rub off some of the perfume onto you making
              the state of Ihram void.

              Men must keep the right shoulder uncovered during the Tawaaf, which is known as Idtibaa. This is done by
              placing the Ridaa beneath the right armpit and taking it up on the left shoulder. Moreover, the men must
              practice ‘raml’ in the first three rounds of Tawaaf, which is essentially walking fast while taking small
              steps. For the rest of the rounds, they can walk on their normal place.

              Upon finishing the seven rounds of Tawaaf, the pilgrim must then go to the station of Ibrahim (Maqaam e
              Ibrahim) and recite the following words:

              “And take you (people) the Maqaam (place) of Ibraaheem (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibraaheem
              (Abraham) stood while he was building the Ka’bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. two
              Rak‘at after the Tawaaf of the Ka’bah at Makkah)” (Surah Baqarah:125)

              The pilgrim should then offer two rakaat of prayer behind Maqaam e Ibrahim. If that is proving difficult,
              the pilgrim can offer the prayers in any spot of the mosque. During the first rakah, Surah Al-Kafirun
              (109) is recited and for the second rakah, Surah Al-Ikhlaas (112) is recited. Upon offering the prayer,
              the individual should head back to the Black Stone and touch it if possible.

              3) Saa’i between Safa and Marwah
              The pilgrim should then head for the place of Saa’i (Masaa) and when he/she nears the hill of Safa, the
              following should be recited:

              “Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Mecca) are of the Symbols of Allah” (Surah Baqarah:158)

              And

              “Nabda’u bima bada’a Allaah bihi”

              (We start with that with which Allah started)

              The pilgrim must then climb up on the Safa hill to a point from where the Ka’bah is visible. He/she should
              face the Ka’bah, raise his/her hand and supplicate to Allah (SWT). The pilgrim is free to make whatever
              dua he/she desires. According to a hadith, the Holy Prophet (PBUH) recited the following dua as praise:

              “Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk, wa lahu’l-hamd, wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in
              qadeer. Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wahdah, anjaza wa’dah, wa nasara ‘abdah, wa hazamaa al-ahzaaba wahdah”

              (There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion, all praise is due to
              Him, and He is able to do all things. There is no god but Allah alone; he fulfilled His promise, granted
              victory to His slave, and defeated the confederates alone).” (Sahih Muslim, 1218)

              The pilgrim should repeat this 3 times; do dhikr, supplicate, do dhikr, supplicate (and so on). Then the
              pilgrim should descend down to Marwah and the men are to run between the green lights. The distance is
              marked by two green markers – the men should run till the second marker and then walk up normally to the
              hill of Marwah and climb up. There, the pilgrim must face the Qibla and recite what he/she said at Safa.
              After that, the pilgrim must descend again and head towards Safa. Upon reaching Safa, the pilgrim must
              repeat what he/she did the first time and repeat the same when he/she goes back to Marwah for seven
              circuits (One circuit is from Safa to Marwah).

              4) Shaving the head/Cutting of Hair
              Lastly, upon the completion of the seven circuits, the pilgrim is required to cut his/her hair. The men
              are required to shave their heads or cut their hair on their entire head equally. The women are required
              to cut their hair equal to the length of a fingertip.

              With this last act, the pilgrim officially completes his/her Umrah.

              Hopefully, this article will prove to be useful to those planning on performing the Umrah soon. May Allah
              (SWT) accept your duas and good deeds. Ameen!
